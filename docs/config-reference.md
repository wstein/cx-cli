# CX Configuration Reference

## Safe project names

The `project_name` field must be filesystem-safe and follow a narrow naming policy:

- Allowed characters: letters, numbers, dot (`.`), underscore (`_`), hyphen (`-`).
- Must start with a letter or number.
- Used to derive bundle artifacts such as `project-manifest.toon`, `project.sha256`, and `project-repomix-<section>.<ext>`.

Invalid values are rejected when loading `cx.toml` or when running `cx init --name`.

## Path expansion

The configuration supports expanding paths before they are resolved:

- `~` and `~/...` are expanded to the current user home directory.
- `$VAR` and `${VAR}` are expanded from environment variables.
- `{project}` is replaced with the configured `project_name`.

The resolved paths are then normalized relative to the directory containing `cx.toml`.

Example:

```toml
source_root = "~/projects/$WORKSPACE/src"
output_dir = "dist/{project}-bundle"
```

## Bundle invariants

A generated bundle must satisfy these invariants:

- Exactly one manifest file must exist in the bundle directory.
- The checksum file must list:
  - the manifest file
  - every section output file
  - every stored asset file
- `cx verify` fails if the checksum file omits any expected artifact, if a stored file hash does not match, or if `--against` detects source-tree drift.
- Section output names are deterministic and derived from `project_name` plus the section name.

When `manifest.include_output_spans = true`, `cx bundle` computes per-file spans using absolute line numbers in the rendered section output. `output_start_line` is the first bare content line of the file block, and `output_end_line` is the last bare content line. XML/Markdown/JSON/plain wrapper lines are not part of the span itself, but wrapper lines that appear earlier in the output file affect the absolute start and end positions.

For details on how `cx` validates and verifies bundles, see `src/bundle/verify.ts` and `src/bundle/validate.ts`.
